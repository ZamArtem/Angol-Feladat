            <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hungarian Parliament, also known as the Budapest Parliament, has become one of the city’s main symbols. It is also one of the best-known structures in Europe. It is the third largest assembly building in the world, after the Parliament of Romania and the National Congress of Argentina.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded between 1884 and 1902, the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary was the biggest building of its time. It has 691 rooms and is 879 ft (268 m) long and 404 ft (123 m) wide.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vastness of the Parliament was a sign of the economic power of Hungary at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

            <p class="par">The tour that takes approximately 50 minutes will take visitors through the most spectacular rooms in the building, including:</p>
            <ul class="ulpar">
                <li>Staircase XVII: The tour of the House of Parliament begins by walking up the main staircase of the building, covered with red carpet. Visitors will come upon the building’s most impressive floor, where a high relief of Imre Steindl, the structure’s architect welcomes the visitors.</li>
                <li>Dome Hall: The Dome hall is 88 ft (27 m) tall and from where you can see the inside of the dome. It houses several statues of the kings of Hungary, such as Stephen I. The Hungarian Holy Crown and the Coronation Insignia are also held in this room.</li>
                <li>The Old Upper House Hall: The Old Upper House Hall is currently opened to tourists and is exactly how one would imagine it to be; with beautiful oak furniture and gold-plated decorations. The Council of Deputies is identical to the Upper House Hall and is located in the south wing.</li>

            <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What stories do the statues of Heroes' Square tell?
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the centre stands the statue of Archangel Gabriel on a 36 m column. In his left hand, he holds a double cross and in his right the Holy Crown, because, according to the legend, Stephen, the first king of Hungary was prompted by the Archangel in a dream to convert to Christianity and crown himself. Not only did the work prove to be popular with Hungarians: it also won the grand prize of the 1900 Paris World's Fair.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base of Gabriel's column is surrounded by the equestrian statues of the chieftains of the seven Hungarian tribes, led by Grand Prince Árpád.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonnades feature 2.8 m bronze statues of historical figures that played an active role in creating modern Hungary. Each has a related relief depicting a scene typical of that person’s era or activity.</p>

            <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today visitors to Heroes' Square are greeted by the following:
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, in the second half of the 19th century, an ornamental fountain designed by renowned Hungarian architect Miklós Ybl stood in Heroes' Square (Hősök tere), at the end of Andrássy Avenue. The Gloriette Well was ultimately relocated to Széchenyi Hill (where it has since been functioning as a lookout point), as an imposing monument was designed to take its place to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of 896: the Millennium Monument. Architect Albert Schickedanz and sculptor György Zala were asked by Sándor Wekerle, Prime Minister at the time, to design the monument.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monument comprises two semi-circular colonnades and a central group of sculptures. Today, the statues of the colonnades are not entirely identical with the original statues, some having been replaced over time for historical reasons.</p>

            <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towering over the Danube, Budapest's Castle Hill (Várhegy) contains many of the city's most important medieval monuments and museums. Topping the list of these impressive structures is the 18th-century Buda Castle (Budavári Palota), a massive 200-room palace that replaced a 13th-century castle built to protect the stronghold from Mongol and Tartar attacks.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although badly damaged in World War II, much of the exterior has been restored, along with sections of the interior, which now houses a number of important museums. These include the Hungarian National Gallery in the main wing, while in the south wing, the Budapest History Museum occupies four floors.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the castle, overlooking the Danube, stands a bronze equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy, a hero of Turkish attacks on the city. Castle Hill is worth exploring for its medieval lanes and it Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque architecture. This entire historic complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

            <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overlooking the Danube, on the spot where the city's fishermen's guild built their defence walls in the Middle Ages, stands the impressive Fisherman's Bastion (Halászbástya). This exquisite collection of Neo-Romanesque towers, courtyards, colonnades, and walls was built between 1895 and 1902, and is one of the most popular points in the city for tourists, largely for its spectacular views over the city and the Danube.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While here, be sure to look for the bronze equestrian statue of St. Stephen, the first King of Hungary, in the south courtyard. The reliefs on the sides of the base depict scenes from Stephen's life, and make for an incredible selfie backdrop.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more great photo ops, head to the upper towers or turrets. There's a small entry fee, but it helps reduce crowding on that part of the attraction.

            <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budapest's St. Stephen's Basilica (Szent István-bazilika) is a popular attraction for its impressive architecture, the beauty of its interior, and the panoramic views from its dome. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Stephen, Hungary's holy king and the founder of the Hungarian state, and construction began in 1851, but after several construction setbacks—including the collapse of its unfinished dome—it was not dedicated until 1905.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof, towers, and external walls were badly damaged in World War II, and the church's precious mosaics fell from the walls. However, these were successfully restored to their original place and are the highlight of the richly decorated interior. The most impressive of these, the five-part Venetian mosaic is in the sanctuary and represents the allegories of the mass.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cathedral's most precious holy relic, the mummified right hand of the church's patron saint, the first king of Hungary, is displayed under glass in the chapel to the left of the high altar.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best things to do here, if time permits, is to take one of the two elevators that carry visitors up to the cupola for sweeping 360-degree views over the city and the Danube (alternatively, you can climb the 364 steps). Guided tours of the basilica are available on weekdays. Also, be sure to check the cathedral's website for details of one of its frequent organ and classical music concerts.

                <p class="par">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Danube (or "Duna" in Hungarian) flows through Budapest from north to south, and in some places within city boundaries is as much as 640 meters wide. One of the top free things to do in Budapest is strolling along the Danube Promenade (Dunakorzó), a pleasant century-old riverside walk that extends between the Elisabeth and Széchenyi Chain Bridges.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many places from which to enjoy views of the majestic river as you stroll its banks (either the Buda or Pest sides, they're both good), the Danube Promenade is definitely one of the best vantage points to take in views of the city's stunning architecture.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also on the banks of the Danube (the northeast side, close to the Hungarian Parliament buildings) that you'll find the chilling Shoes on the Danube Bank memorial. It consists of a series of 60 pairs of steel sculpted shoes memorializing Jews shot here by the Nazis, and is a poignant and moving reminder of the Nazi atrocities suffered by Hungary in World War II.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great way to view the city is via a boat cruise along the Danube. Numerous tourist excursions depart regularly from the landing stages at Vigadó tér on the Pest bank and Bem József tér on the Buda bank, and are highly recommended. It's also fun watching these sturdy vessels from the historic Freedom Bridge as they whip down river only to have to struggle back against the current.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, you could enjoy incredible views on a budget by taking a ride on the number 2 tram. Skirting the eastern bank of the Danube, it's considered to be one of the most beautiful tram lines in the world.
